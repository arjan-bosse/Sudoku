Sudoku.

Windows Forms application in C#. Integrated command line analyser in Java.

About the puzzles: each puzzle has a cryptic name based on the (more difficult) patterns present in the puzzle.

The Java analyser recognizes the following patterns:
ns=naked single
hs=hidden single
np=naked pair
hp=hidden pair
nt=naked triple
ht=hidden triple
nq=naked quad
hq=hidden quad
lc=locked candidate
xw=x-wing
sf=swordfish
yf=yellyfish
xy=xy-wing
g=guess
