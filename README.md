Sudoku.

Let the computer help to analyse and solve Sudoku puzzles.

The (Java) analyser recognizes the following patterns:
ns=naked single
hs=hidden single
np=naked pair
hp=hidden pair
nt=naked triple
ht=hidden triple
nq=naked quad
hq=hidden quad
lc=locked candidate
xw=x-wing
sf=swordfish
yf=yellyfish
xy=xy-wing
g=guess

At the point of 'guessing' the (C#) solver comes with a limited version of solving chains.
